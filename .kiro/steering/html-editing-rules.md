# HTML Editing Rules - CRITICAL

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

**NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES:**
- Write to `.vscode/settings.json`
- Modify any workspace settings
- Set `html.autoClosingTags` or ANY editor configuration
- Touch ANY settings file

## ALLOWED ACTIONS ONLY

When editing HTML files:
1. Read the file content
2. Modify ONLY the file content
3. Write back the modified content
4. DO NOT configure ANY editor settings

## Error Prevention

If you encounter a settings-related error:
- IGNORE IT and proceed with file editing
- Use direct file write operations only
- Skip any auto-configuration steps
